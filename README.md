## üõ†Ô∏è Portfolio Code Details

### **React-based Portfolio**

This portfolio is built with **React.js** and utilizes a **mobile-first** design approach to ensure great user experiences across devices. The features and technologies incorporated into the portfolio are:

- **Responsive Layout**: The site adapts beautifully to different screen sizes, providing an optimal experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Smooth Animations**: Using **React Spring**, I‚Äôve added animations to enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of the page.
- **Reusable Components**: The layout is modular, with reusable React components for better maintainability and scalability.
- **State Management**: I use React‚Äôs hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage state and lifecycle methods across the app.
- **Deployment**: The app is deployed on **Netlify** for quick, reliable, and global access.

### **Code Structure:**
- The project is organized into components, each responsible for a specific section of the portfolio (e.g., Header, About, Skills, Projects).
- **CSS Modules** are used to scope styles to individual components, keeping the styles maintainable and preventing global CSS conflicts.
- **GitHub Actions** is set up for continuous integration, ensuring that all code changes are automatically tested and deployed.
